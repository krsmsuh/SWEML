Global snow water equivalent product derived from machine learning model trained with in situ measurement data

## Introduction

This project presents the global `snow water equivalent` dataset derived from a machine learning model trained with in situ measurement.

The detailed description is shown in this paper:
(DOI link is TBD..)

## DESCRIPTION 

This project is based on Python.

The code information 
* Model: Machine learning (Random forest regression, RFR.py); Machine learning (Random forest classification, RFC.py)
* Cluster: MiniBatchKMeans (Cluster.py)
* Validation: Data handle for validation with Reference datasets (VAL.py); Error value Calculation with each site (VAL.py)
* Figure: Fig 2(Fig2_hist.R; Fig2_map.py); Fig 3(VAL.py); Fig 4(Cluster.py); Fig 5(Fig5.m); FigFigure 6-10(VAL.py)

* Data: The data is so big. For example, one dataset required for clustering is approximately 6GB. Therefore, if you need access to the required data, please send a request to the email below, and it will be shared promptly.
